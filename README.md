SHOPPING CART IMPLEMENTATION

Objectives:
1. Users should be able to add items to cart. The cart should be accessible from a separate route. The cart should be accessed by clicking the shopping cart icon.
2. Users must sign-in before they can add anything to the cart. If users who have not signed-in try to add any items to the cart, they should be redirected to the sign in page.
3. Users should be able to order items by price.
